# CNN-based Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained to recognize and differentiate between images of cats and dogs using a labeled dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing on new images.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The dataset used consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. It is typically divided into training and testing sets.
- **Objective:** The objective is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify images as either a cat or a dog.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset containing images of cats and dogs.
   - Resize images, normalize pixel values, and apply any necessary data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping) to increase the diversity of the training data.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Implement a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers.
   - Add fully connected layers and a softmax output layer for classification.
   - The model architecture may include techniques like dropout and batch normalization to improve performance.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
   - Train the model on the training dataset while validating its performance on a validation set.
   - Track accuracy and loss during training.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
   - Generate classification reports, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Model Testing:**
   - Test the model on new, unseen images of cats and dogs.
   - Visualize the predictions to assess the model's generalization ability.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-dog-classifier.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cat-dog-classifier
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook CNN_based_Cat_and_Dog_Image_Classifier.ipynb


4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The trained CNN model achieves high accuracy in classifying images of cats and dogs. The final model's performance is reported in terms of accuracy, and the results are visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.
